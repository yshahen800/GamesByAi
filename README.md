The 8-Queens problem is a classic puzzle that challenges you to place 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard such
that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. For example, a queen can attack another queen
in its row, column, or diagonal path. The goal is to identify all valid configurations where the constraints are
satisfied.

The chessboard can be represented as a 2D grid, where each row is a list, and the entire board is a list of 8
rows. A '1' in the grid represents a queen, and '0' represents an empty cell.

Implement the 8-Queens problem using BFS and DFS algorithms.
2. Compare the results from BFS and DFS by analyzing:
- Total number of valid solutions found.
- Execution time for each algorithm.
3. Calculate the execution time for both algorithms and report it accurately.
